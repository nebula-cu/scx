- `rorke_select_cpu`
    - when a vcpu wakes up, it will call this function.
    - if there is an idle cpu, it will pick one and directly insert to its local dsq.
    - if there is no idle cpu, it will insert to the corresponding vm dsq.
    - guaranteed to skip `enqueue` as we always insert to some dsq here.
- `rorke_enqueue`
    - it will be called, when the runnable task is being taken of the cpu.
    - it will insert the vcpu to the corresponding vm dsq.
    - it will check for any idle cpu and trigger scheduling cycle there.
- `rorke_dispatch`
    - when a pcpu is ready to schedule, it first checks its local dsq.
        - if there is a vcpu, pcpu will run it.
        - if local dsq is empty, pcpu will check global dsq.
            - global dsq is not applicable in our case - not used.
        - if both are empty, pcpu will call this function - i.e. `rorke_dispatch`
    - based on ^, it will be only called when local dsq is empty.
    - it will pick(dequeue) a vcpu from the vm dsq and insert into cpu's local dsq.
- `rorke_running`
    - it will be called right before the vcpu is being run on pcpu.
    - it will start the timer for the pcu.
- `rorke_stopping`
    - it will be called right before the vcpu is being stopped on pcpu.


- `timer_callback`
    - it will be called when the timer expires.
    - increases the `preempted` count for the corresponding pcpu.
    - triggers scheduling cycle on the pcpu via `scx_bpf_kick_cpu`.
